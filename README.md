# bank_transaction_sim

This is a simulator of bank transactions. Due to it being a Proof of Concept (POC) or just a Demo, it won't have the correct structure that a software like this should have. But I feel necessary to document how the correct structure should look like as far as I know.

## Correct Structure

### Repository

- SHOULD HAVE been divided in issues/feats, branches for each and a validated and tested merge request.
- IS following the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

### Project Structure

- DataBase Containing the data
